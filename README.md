# Vendor lock-in in a public cloud

Simple terraform setup to show provisioning to heroku. 



## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below


### Prerequisites

We assume you have pre-installed:

- Terraform - https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
- You have homebrew installed? Then you could also install terraform via cli:
`brew install terraform`


If you don't have a heroku account yet, you need to create one:

* Heroku - https://www.heroku.com/



### Installing

First you have to clone the Repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:bennias/tf-heroku.git
```

Navigate into the project-directory and run terraform:

```
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
